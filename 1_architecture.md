## üîç 1. **Data Ingestion Layer**

### Sources:

* Social media (Twitter/X, Reddit, TikTok trends)
* News APIs (GNews, NewsAPI, RSS feeds)
* Google Trends, Trendogate
* Internal newsroom archives

### Tech Stack:

* Kafka or Pulsar for streaming
* Airflow or Prefect for batch jobs

---

## üß† 2. **Preprocessing & NLP Engine**

### Tasks:

* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to detect persons, locations, orgs
* **Topic Classification** (zero-shot or multi-label)
* **Summarization** (Abstractive & extractive)
* **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**
* **Source De-duplication**

### Tools & Models:

* spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers (`bart-large-cnn`, `distilbert`, `llama`, `mistral`)
* FastText or BERTopic for topic modeling

---

## üìà 3. **Trend & Pattern Analysis**

### Techniques:

* Time-series anomaly detection (Prophet, Twitter AnomalyDetection)
* Topic velocity and momentum metrics
* Geo-demographic breakout detection (e.g. sudden interest in a topic in a region)
* Virality scoring (based on shares/comments/likes growth)

### Models:

* **Clustering models** (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) for event detection
* **Change-point detection** for topic shifts
* Graph-based topic propagation modeling

---

## üß© 4. **Story Angle Suggestion Engine**

### Inputs:

* Trending topic clusters
* Historical context from archives
* Entity/event relationships

### Methods:

* **Prompted LLMs** (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude, or fine-tuned Mistral)
* **Knowledge Graph Traversal** to surface context (Wikidata + newsroom archives)
* Templates: "What does X mean for Y?" | "Who are the voices missing in the story?"

### Output:

* Suggested angles, headlines, supporting quotes, data visuals

---

## üìä 5. **Story Impact Prediction Module**

### Objectives:

* Estimate **engagement**, **societal impact**, **misinformation risk**, etc.

### Features:

* Topic sensitivity
* Audience affinity (based on reader personas)
* Virality predictors
* Expert attention score (e.g., citations, think tank mentions)

### ML Models:

* Gradient Boosting Machines or XGBoost for interpretability
* Neural networks for engagement (historical click/view data)

---

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è 6. **Human-in-the-Loop Interface**

### Roles:

* **Editor** reviews, curates, adjusts or rejects suggestions
* **Reporter** explores alternate angles and adds context
* **Fact-checker** validates AI-supported claims

### UI Features:

* Real-time trend dashboard
* Angle suggestion explorer
* Contextual timeline
* Impact prediction slider (with explanations)

---

## üßÆ 7. **Governance & Ethics Layer**

### Principles:

* **Transparency**: Log all AI recommendations
* **Accountability**: All published content must be approved by a human
* **Bias Audits**: Regular model evaluations using diverse datasets
* **Explainability**: Every recommendation must be traceable and explainable

### Tools:

* Fairness toolkits (e.g., IBM AI Fairness 360)
* Model interpretability libraries (SHAP, LIME)
* Ethics Committee Review Board (journalists + technologists)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 8. **Filter Bubble Avoidance Mechanisms**

* Diversified source ingestion (local news, alt-media, etc.)
* Editorial knobs to adjust diversity of suggestions
* Random injection of contrarian views or underrepresented angles
* Topic fatigue detection (avoid over-saturation)

## ‚úÖ Example Workflow

1. **Ingestion**: The system detects a spike in Reddit mentions of "AI regulation bill in Europe".
2. **Trend Analyzer**: Flags sudden growth in engagement in Germany and France.
3. **Angle Generator**: Suggests: *"How the EU‚Äôs AI Act Could Influence India‚Äôs IT Law"* and *"Tech Startups Brace for Regulation Wave"*.
4. **Impact Predictor**: Rates ‚Äúhigh policy impact‚Äù and ‚Äúmedium reader interest‚Äù.
5. **Editor** reviews and decides to pursue the India angle with added interviews.
6. **Publication** is logged with metadata from AI suggestions and human overrides.
